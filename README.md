Quando Parte
============

Quando Parte (_Italian: When is it leaving?_) is a program designed to quickly
check (Italian) railway timetables and delays at train stations you use from 
your smartphone. It is based on the viaggiatreno.it service of the Trenitalia 
railways operator, and on train station data collected by Openstreetmap.

The aim of the program is to be a quick tool to manage your time when
commuting. It remembers the stations you are interested in, and you can quickly
look them up to see if the service is working regularly. 

Ports
-----

Currently Quando Parte has ports for the following platforms:

* Sailfish OS,
* Meego Harmattan and
* Maemo5 (stale)

but it should be fairly easy to port to platforms where Qt 4.7 or above is available.
